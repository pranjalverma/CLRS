# CLRS, 3rd Edition

### So what's this about?
These are my solutions (and attempts) to various algorithmic problems in CLRS, 3rd Edition. ðŸ”¥ðŸ’»

### Everything's in C++14, are you an expert?
No, well I try to be, this repo is also my way of learning and familiarising with C++, as I've always been a python3 programmer before this repo existed, so if you stumble upon this repo and decide it's worth your time to use my code (for homework or whatever), do keep in mind that there might be better implementations and/or methods of solving these questions out there.

TL;DR

Nope.

### So is this repo useless then?
Well, not quite, I do try my best to implement the best solution to a problem as best in C++ as possible. I research the question quite a bit before finalising on an answer and also post code regularly on [this amazing website](https://stackoverflow.com) and [this other amazing website](https://codereview.stackexchange.com) to ensure I'm not angrying the C++ Gods.

TL;DR

It's not completely useless.

I hope.

### Is this repo completed?
Nah, probably will take a long long time before I'm done.

### Can I use this code?
Yeah, Idc. :) ðŸŽ‰
