# CLRS, 3rd Edition

### So what's this about?
These are my solutions (and attempts) to various algorithmic problems in CLRS, 3rd Edition ðŸ”¥ðŸ’»

### Everything's in C++14, are you an expert?
No, well I try to be, this repo is also my way of learning and familiarising with C++, as I've always been a python3 programmer before this repo existed, so if you stumble upon this repo and decide it's worth your time to use my code (for homework or whatever), do keep in mind that there might be better implementations and/or methods of solving these questions out there.

TL;DR

Nope.

### So is this repo useless then?
Well, not quite, I do try my best to implement the best solution to a problem as best in C++ as possible. I research the question quite a bit before finalising on an answer, websites like [this one](https://cs.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) help a lot. I also post code regularly on [this amazing website](https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic) and [this other amazing website](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) to ensure I'm not angrying the C++ Gods.

TL;DR

It's not completely useless.

I hope.

### Do you cover every question in the book?
No. While I do attempt/solve every single question in the book for whatever I'm studying in my own time, this repo is mainly for the interesting implementation-type questions, i.e. interesting questions that can be coded in a programming language. I'll post all these codable questions here, and if some theoretical-type question seems super interesting to me, I may also write a note about my solution for it in the respective chapter's markdown file.

TL;DR

Nah, this repo's mainly for codable questions, but you may find notes on some theoretical-type questions that I found really interesting here and there.

[Here's a great proper solution manual for CLRS I use.](http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html)

### Is this repo just about CLRS?
Nah, not really. I do love this book a lot but like I said, I try to research a problem/concept quite a bit before coding it up, so I use other references as well; [Skiena](http://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf), [Lehman & Leighton's Math for CS](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf) and online coding judges are main alternatives. This repo is mainly focused on CLRS, but it'll have sprinkles of code for problems/concepts from other sources as well, like those mentioned above.

Obviously I'll point it out whenever that's the case.

TL;DR

Not really, code from other references is included as well, and will be highlighted wherever it occurs.

### Is this repo completed?
Nah, probably will take a `long long` (hah) time before I'm done.

### Can I use this code?
Yeah, Idc. :) ðŸŽ‰
